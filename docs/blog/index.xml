1 $ hugo server -DEF --noHTTPCache --disableFastRender _index.md 和 index.md 的区别 参考
_index.md: branch bundle, 该会展示该目录下的资源 index.md: leaf bundle, 只展示该 index.md Front Matter 就是在 md 文件开头, 用于描述元信息的数据, 可以是 yaml, json 等

Other operations falling into miscellaneous categories include shaping, planing, boring, broaching and sawing.[5]
Turning operations are operations that rotate the workpiece as the primary method of moving metal against the cutting tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning. Milling operations are operations in which the cutting tool rotates to bring cutting edges to bear against the workpiece.</description></item><item><title>Our Manufacturing Process Part I</title><link>https://jdxj.github.io/blog/p1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jdxj.github.io/blog/p1/</guid><description>Machining is any of various processes in which a piece of raw material is cut into a desired final shape and size by a controlled material-removal process. The processes that have this common theme, controlled material removal, are today collectively known as subtractive manufacturing,[1] in distinction from processes of controlled material addition, which are known as additive manufacturing. Exactly what the &amp;ldquo;controlled&amp;rdquo; part of the definition implies can vary, but it almost always implies the use of machine tools (in addition to just power tools and hand tools).</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jdxj.github.io/blog/building/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jdxj.github.io/blog/building/</guid><description>Characterizations A convex quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is any one of the following
