Arc any connected part of a circle. Specifying two end points of an arc and a center allows for two arcs that together make up a full circle. Centre the point equidistant from all points on the circle. Chord a line segment whose endpoints lie on the circle, thus dividing a circle in two segments. Circumference the length of one circuit along the circle, or the distance around the circle.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://jdxj.github.io/blog/community/curve/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jdxj.github.io/blog/community/curve/</guid><description>&lt;p>In mathematics, a curve (also called a curved line in older texts) is, generally speaking, an object similar to a line but that need not be straight. Thus, a curve is a generalization of a line, in that it may be curved.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
