A convex quadrilateral is a square if and only if it is any one of the following

* a rectangle with two adjacent equal sides
* a rhombus with a right vertex angle
* a rhombus with all angles equal
* a parallelogram with one right vertex angle and two adjacent equal sides
* a quadrilateral with four equal sides and four right angles
* a quadrilateral where the diagonals are equal and are the perpendicular bisectors of each other, i.e. a rhombus with equal diagonals
* a convex quadrilateral with successive sides a, b, c, d whose area is A = 1/2(a<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>) =  1/2(b<sup>2</sup> + d<sup>2</sup>)
